# Satellite Image Classification using CNN.

The use of multimedia in applications for artificial intelligence, 
such as video summarization, picture retrieval, and image 
categorisation, is a fascinating and futuristic topic. 
In this project, we are creating a system to classify satellite 
images of 3 different datasets using 3 different CNN models and 
comparing their results with high-level observations. The CNN models we used are ResNet18, VGG19 and DenseNet121. The datasets in which we implemented these models are Satellite Data, EuroSAT and Amazon Planet Dataset. 
    
## Datasets

Following are the details and download links of our datasets.
It should be downloaded in local machine in order to run our models.
